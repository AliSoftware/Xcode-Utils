This directory contain some useful File Tempates to add to Xcode, so that you can create new .h/.m files based on those templates.

To install those File Templates on your mac, copy the templates directory into:
 ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/File Templates 

Note that the ".pbfiletemplate" directory should be in a subdirectory (e.g. "Cocoa Class") of the "File Templates" directory to be visible in the Xcode's New File wizard.
