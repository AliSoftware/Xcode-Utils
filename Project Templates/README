This directory contain some useful Project Tempates to add to Xcode, so that you can create new Xcode projects based on those templates.

To install those Project Templates on your mac, copy the templates directory into:
 ~/Library/Application Support/Developer/Shared/Xcode/Project Templates 

Note that the directory containing the project template should itself be in a subdirectory (e.g. "Cocoa Application") of the "Project Templates" directory to be visible in the Xcode's New Project wizard.
